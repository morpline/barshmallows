inspired by Rhys Nielsen

# Update Alpha 3 Notes
Added images to main branch;

Changed how the game does some behind-the-scenes stuff;

Made the game less cpu hungry; made certain thangs happen only when necessary, like:

    updating money count,

    updating barshmallows,

    updating selected barshmallows;

    loading barshmallows doesn't;

Added "New Game" button;

Simplified the Barshmallow construct;
