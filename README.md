NEW PEOPLE:

    Mr. Smith

        A successful old man who wants you to prove yourself to him as a barshmallow breeder, and maybe get a couple things out of it too. He lives in town, and you see him every once in a while.

    Soop Mahm

        A creepy Indian dude who wants wierd barshmallow pics but pays fairly well. He can barely speak english.

    Azis Anim

        A self-proclaimed 'wizard' who wants the 'essence' of barshmallows for his 'magic'. There may be something behind those claims, though.

    Ard T. Adenina

        A scientist interested in the study of barshmallows, specifically their origin and wether their stange properties can be used for good, like in medicines or technology. 

Mr. Smith is the only one with actual functionality built right now, others will be added eventually.
